# inlinecalc
Inline Calculator, an Xed Plugin in Python  

In any Xed document or text you can simply type an expression and press CTRL+ENTER on the same line to calculate it.  

Example:  
> 1 + 2 * (sin(rad(45)) - 1.25)  
> = -0.08578641  

To use the plugin, place the src files into '/usr/lib/.../xed/plugins/' or something similar.

# Code format note
It looks really poorly formatted on github.  
I personally use tabs with 4-space width indentation and github uses 8-space for some reason.
